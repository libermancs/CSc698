2/15/2019 11:08:46,2,"I gave this class a 2 because it is too fast for everyone to catch up and we barely have any time to communicate with each other. Also you scammed us of pizza, and I think you should stop giving us so much work, even though we don't have homework, it's still not good.",,,,,
2/15/2019 11:06:05,3,Mr. Liberman is a fun teacher but we have to right SO MUCH and write so much essays whcih make skids stressed out,,,,,
2/15/2019 11:06:52,3,I like this class because my friend is in this class. I hate this class because there is TOO MUCH work. And things go TOO FAST. Sometimes I can't catch up.,,,,,
2/15/2019 11:07:21,3,It's fun and everything but we watch too many videos and we take too many notes. Something that could make the class better is if Mr.Liberman gives us our pizza on time. We should play more games. We should pick our own seats. So... yeah.,,,,,
2/15/2019 11:07:34,3,It's kind of boring and has not  been any  projects in a while :(.Mabye more projects and free time.,,,,,

-----ppppppppppppppppppppppppp why do i have o writ more",,,,,
2/15/2019 11:10:14,3,i gave this score because this class is helpful. A good thing is that Mr.Libermen wants you to get a good grade. A bad thing is that we have to do a lot of note taking. Nothing will make this class better.,,,,,
2/15/2019 11:56:54,3,"I have no opinion, the class was fine! To make the class better I think that we should no rush anything.",,,,,
2/15/2019 13:07:27,3,We don´t really listen. We don´t stay on track. We also have a few people that listen and don´t interrupt or get distracted.,,,,,
2/15/2019 13:40:02,3,Maybe we should do less writing and more videos/annotating taking notes takes more time and sometimes I can't read everything. If we do take notes you could maybe give us more time to finish them.,,,,,
2/15/2019 13:40:37,3,It is good but we have to write a lot of notes and it would be better if people could sit with friends and we did more interactive activities.,,,,,
2/15/2019 14:38:11,3,"Some people talk a lot and we are very loud, but this teacher is very good. We could have harsher punishments. Also, get rid of the mic ball because that makes people nervous. Lastly, take less notes.",,,,,
2/15/2019 15:30:21,3,I like that Mr. Liberman doesn't yell at us that much. I don't like that we have soooooooo many notes to take. Maybe you could give us pre-printed notes or something?,,,,,

2/15/2019 11:07:08,4,I rate this class a four because we have to take a lot of notes but we get to take our notes digitally. It should also be so that we should choose our own seats. We also let us out late. I mostly enjoy the class because we get to take notes digitally  and because I have friends in this class.,,,,,
2/15/2019 11:07:17,4,it's a good class but you need to give us less notes to take and give us time to pack up for our next class,,,,,

2/15/2019 11:57:52,4,I gave it this score because it is hard to get AWW points with the time we are given. Other than that it is my favorite class.,,,,,

2/15/2019 11:58:18,4,i think its a good class because its a good learning enviornment and something that i dont like is we move a little too fast and we dont have enough time to write notes down.,,,,,

2/15/2019 11:59:07,4,"The teacher is good. The class is interesting. I'm having no struggles. Te projects are fun. lastly, I kinda think that since the projects we have to buy out own supplies we should have a project with only paper",,,,,

2/15/2019 13:40:08,4,this class is very fun and intertaing. the only thing is that people are interupting  the calls and its anoying. ,,,,,
2/15/2019 13:40:20,4,This class could be better by having more control over troublemakers *cough cough* Gabriel *cough cough*. You should not let students take advantage of you.,,,,,
2/15/2019 13:40:26,4,"This class is pretty fun and I feel like i'm actually learning.  Unlike other classes, this class is very interesting (I can cube).",,,,,
2/15/2019 13:40:45,4,I rate this class a 4 because sometimes we write a lot and it starts to get a little boring. Plus sometimes we don't get enough time to do things.,,,,,

2/15/2019 13:41:44,4,Why I gave it the score I did was that some people are loud and interrupt when Mr. Lieberman is talking.  I like this class because most of the pople are nice. What I don't like is that Some people are loud and interrupt when Mr. Lieberman is talking.  I don't know aht could make this class better sorry.,,,,,
2/15/2019 13:42:04,4,This class is good because it is right after lunch. Something bad about this class is that it is far away from my next class. Nothing could make this class better.,,,,,

2/15/2019 13:42:26,4,This is a good class but there is too many notes to take. Something good about this class is that we get to do fun projects from what we learned. Maybe we could do other things than taking notes to make this class better.,,,,,
2/15/2019 13:42:29,4,"Talks too fast, video too fast, reading had too much words and too little time. Tells us answers after video but says it too fast. lets us talk. too much work. Fun class, should say the answer twice after the video. Keeps on blocking the board and should get a better quality screen and pull the projector back.",,,,,
2/15/2019 13:42:53,4,I gave this score because some people in the class are very annoying and they are  loud. But other then that this lass is very good a lot are people are nice to me and nice to everyone.,,,,,

2/15/2019 14:38:30,4,"I gave this score because the class barely has homework, Mr. Liberman makes things easy and simple, and many other things I can't name. There is nothing bad about the class, but something to make it better is controlling some of the students a little more.",,,,,

2/15/2019 14:39:05,4,"It seems better than Z's because they have to do chapter notes and honestly just seems hard, but this class is pretty decent for social studies, even though I personally think social studies is boring and I don't really like it. Also, we actually learn stuff about writing essays, which we don't learn in booth's class. there's a lot of writing and notes tho, and tests are kinda not really hard. anyways, you're probably one of my favorite teachers.",,,,,

I don't like how much note taking there is. and i don't like the questions I would prefer if Mr liberman just lectured us instead of made us take notes.,,,,,
2/15/2019 14:39:36,4,"I like this class because I learn a lot. The teacher (Mr.Liberman) is very experienced and obviously knows the history. I learned more in this class than any other. I only have a small problem, that the actual learning is not very interactive. I suggest adding more interactions with the students rather taking notes on papers and videos. In all, I believe it is a very good class where I learned a lot.",,,,,

2/15/2019 12:02:13,5,The reasons I like this class is because we get to memorize the content. One other thing I like is that we normally get to choose some things. We can choose whether we use a notebook or computer. ,,,,,
