They talk when the teacher is talking they we need to improve on that. When the substitute is here they are really loud.,,,
We should learn history through watching educational movies and we should do less webquest.,,,
The way we can improve this class for the last month is to have less work. The reason for that is because we have been working hard for the whole year.,,,

"BECAUSE NOOBS ARE SCARED SUB TO PEWDIEPIE AND KRAAZY 420 on YOUTUBE DON""T FORGET THE NAMES GUYZ",,,
A lot of people keep talking and they are the same students over and over again,,,

because it's true.because it's true.because its true.because it's true.because its true.,,,
I choose the number 3 because its in the middle. It's not bad or the best.,,,
I gave this score because this class is getting better at doing work in the class.,,,
The Reason why I gave that score is because the class is a normal class with a normal amount of good things and bad things. Something that could make the class better is if the everyone in the class could do their work and if all the students don't have flaws in their behavior.,,,
because it's fun and boring and it code be more funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn,,,
i'm starting to like the vid mr piper gives off to me his super nice and i really starting to like the vibe everyone is putting,,,
i would rate this class the best class ever because it is funny and fun and more!,,,
because i don't like school and i don't like this class because we stay in for to long,,,
i gave it that score because i think they could do better and they don't because they want us to stay in.,,,
Because this class is neutral sometimes good sometimes boring and i wish people stop playing around,,,
i give this score because i think 5 period should not clean the class\ the mess 2 and 3 period made.,,,
because it gets better each week and plus if students are doing their work then maybe they don't have to worry about the teachers being mean or they don't have to worry about what teacher comes up to their desk if they are doing what they need to do,,,
Because we are a great doing class but we need to talk less off task. Our class could really talk less in class.,,,
I gave this class a 4 because it is ok I don't hate the class and I find some of the topics in social studies interesting.,,,
More kahoot SFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSFSF,,,
It is okay because we all pay attention to get free time and that's why we listen.,,,
something good about this class is that they pay attention to the teacher. Something bad about this class is that we don't pay attention sometimes.,,,
The good thing about this class is that they do their work. The bad thing is They talk over the teacher.,,,
3 because we talk to much but we do good work if we want to also the class is easy,,,
I gave it this score cause this class is annoying and making us stay in for lunch.,,,
because i feel like we are a good class we still need to improve.on paying attention,,,

"It's a good class things have changed for the better, but also there's things that need to be changed. Like I said last time this class would be better if students don't waste that much time. The good thing about this class is it's actually fun here.",,,
the class isn't that bad and it's also not that good. People are always making us wait and that's really annoying.,,,
i gave this score because our class works on the work we are assigned too but the class doesn't become quiet fast.,,,
I would give the class a 4 out of 5 because this class is good but it still needs some improvement.,,,
I still Have to turn in a lot of work. But I did turn most of the stuff though you just haven't got to it.,,,
i gave it this score because sometimes this class could be loud. dmkjhhusfdhu,,,
because we try to focus a lot and we try and finish our work early even though we can get distracted by things we still try and finish our work .,,,
All the laughs and the roasting it is kinda annoying but we make it threw the period but its fine and i'm writing this cuz it says for me to write a full sentence and i did it sooooooo byeeeeee.,,,
Because it sucks,,,
Something good about this class is that they do their work and they try their best. What's bad is that they talk to much. If this class focus more to the teacher.,,,
cause we don't get enough time to finish and i cant focus at home. and we always do different things everyday,,,
"This class could be better when we do more free time, and maybe that's it....",,,
because there is so much talking but then there is quiet time and maybe how this class can be better is no time of quiet time.,,,
is getting better. I started to like the class more 999999999999999999999999999999,,,
"I don't think I did good i think I did OK, but I also think I have things missing on my DBQ.",,,
The good is they get quiet the bad thing is they talk over the teacher and it takes a long time to make them quiet,,,
something that is good about this class is that they pay attention to the teacher. something bad about this class is that we waste our time for waiting. and I don't know how to make this class better.,,,

"Its a 3 because the class gets annoying and boring , and we stay in for lunch.",,,
they are okay and nothing is wrong and they could take it seriously,,,
I gave the class this grade because they are pretty good and they don't listen when teacher is talking.,,,
idk be i don't really care tbh but yea just say some random person's name or something like that,,,
the class needs to focus on their work. turn in their work and read more. and do their writing,,,
"This class can be fun and I learn I a lot don't get me wrong. It's just that it's the same thing everyday such as newsela everyday, which can be very boring. At least do kahoot every Monday just to start the week nicely.",,,
it's a good class and things get done but sometimes the students don't do what they are supposed,,,
one thing good about this class is some of the students do their work.,,,
"It's not bad or good, it's like every other class. It is because this class wouldn't be my favorite class.",,,
That you stop yelling at us an be a better teacher not to be rude and grade my missing work,,,
It is 2 because because i need to catch up on companion book. And on other work.,,,
in feel like it is a okay score think the mini lesson are good about this class,,,
because this class is ok but we need more free time to relax and do best we can .,,,
Because it keeps talkingssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss,,,
Because we always wait for everyone and sometimes get free time so it's 2 stars,,,

The class is good but it could be better.(civdjvj kbjibjfi jijijdvnbvcbfghgfrfv) don't mind that.,,,
Because sometimes its good sometimes it's bad well i wish it's always good and quiet,,,
"it's fun for learning, i think it can improve. The kids are sometime rude. I",,,
To much people keep on talking and they play around to much and they are the same people that play around too much,,,
because it is okay and plus it don't really matter how the students act it's about getting your knowledge that you need and that you came to school for,,,
I don't like this class and everything will make this class better. JHbhDSchfihbwdihvwiv,,,
It's not good but its not bad. And it can improve on so many things like people talking ect.,,,

i gave the class a grade because we do not listen.lj hooker;97;ihuw diy qi;oLx,,,
The reason why I gave this class a 5/5 score is because I learned a lot about it and I got good grades.,,,
I gave that score to the class Because the class isn't that good . And most students are very crazy and don't listen as much,,,
It can be more quiet and i can focus more and stay in class . And try to be more respectful to my peers,,,
